# Active Context: App Scanner Dashboard

## Current Status
The project is approximately 70% complete with core infrastructure and several key components implemented. The foundation is solid with a well-structured architecture, but several critical pieces are missing to make it a fully functional application.

## What's Working
✅ **Core Infrastructure**
- Complete TypeScript type definitions
- JSON parser for vulnerability analysis data
- React Context state management
- Custom hooks for data selection
- Tailwind CSS styling system

✅ **Implemented Components**
- SecurityScore: Circular progress gauge
- SeverityBadge: Color-coded severity indicators
- DataTable: Virtualized table component
- Card: Reusable container component
- SeverityChart: Pie chart for severity distribution

✅ **Features Complete**
- Overview page with security metrics
- Data parsing and normalization
- State management with filters
- Chart visualizations

## What's Missing (Critical)
❌ **Main Application Structure**
- No main.tsx entry point
- No App.tsx component
- No routing between pages
- No layout structure

❌ **Findings Page**
- FindingsPage component not implemented
- Filter UI components missing
- FindingDetailDrawer incomplete

❌ **File Upload**
- No file upload functionality
- No drag-drop interface
- No JSON validation

❌ **Missing Components**
- FilterPill component
- SectionChart component
- Complete FindingDetailDrawer

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create main.tsx and App.tsx** - Essential for application to run
2. **Implement FindingsPage** - Core functionality for exploring findings
3. **Complete missing components** - FilterPill, SectionChart, FindingDetailDrawer
4. **Add file upload** - Enable users to load their own JSON files
5. **Test with sample data** - Ensure everything works with the provided JSON

## Current Architecture State
The architecture is well-designed and follows React best practices:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe development
- Efficient state management
- Performance-optimized components

## Data Flow Status
- ✅ JSON → Parser → Domain Objects
- ✅ Domain Objects → Context Store
- ✅ Context Store → Selectors
- ❌ Selectors → UI Components (partially complete)
- ❌ User Interactions → State Updates

## Testing Status
- No automated tests implemented
- Manual testing needed with sample data
- Performance testing required for large datasets

## Known Issues
- Application won't run without main.tsx
- Missing routing between pages
- Incomplete component implementations
- No error handling for malformed JSON

## Priority Order
1. **Critical**: Create main application structure
2. **High**: Implement FindingsPage and missing components
3. **Medium**: Add file upload functionality
4. **Low**: Add error handling and edge cases
