## In Progress üöß

### Missing Critical Components
- **main.tsx**: Application entry point
- **App.tsx**: Main application component
- **FindingsPage**: Core findings exploration page
- **FilterPill**: Filter UI component
- **SectionChart**: Section distribution chart
- **FindingDetailDrawer**: Detailed finding information

### Missing Features
- **File Upload**: Drag-drop JSON upload interface
- **Routing**: Navigation between pages
- **Layout**: Application shell and navigation
- **Error Handling**: JSON validation and error states

## Not Started ‚ùå

### Advanced Features
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/JSON export of filtered data
- **Multi-app Management**: App switcher and management
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, custom filters
- **Search Highlighting**: Highlight search terms in results
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features

### Testing & Quality
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset handling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance

## Technical Debt
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundary implementation
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and loading indicators
- **Empty States**: Better empty state designs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile optimization
- **Performance**: Bundle size optimization

## Current Blockers
1. **No Entry Point**: Application cannot run without main.tsx
2. **Missing Routing**: No navigation between pages
3. **Incomplete Components**: Several key components not implemented
4. **No File Upload**: Cannot load data without manual integration

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 70% complete (core features working)
- **Components**: 60% complete (most UI components done)
- **Features**: 40% complete (basic functionality working)
- **Testing**: 0% complete (no tests implemented)

## Next Milestones
1. **MVP Complete**: Basic application running with sample data
2. **File Upload**: Users can upload their own JSON files
3. **Full Functionality**: All planned features working
4. **Production Ready**: Error handling, testing, optimization

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core architecture is solid
- **Medium Risk**: Missing critical components for basic functionality
- **High Risk**: No testing strategy for large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Focus on MVP first, then add advanced features
