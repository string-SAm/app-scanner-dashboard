# Product Context: App Scanner Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Mobile app security analysis tools generate large, complex JSON reports that are difficult to navigate and analyze. Security teams need a better way to:
- Quickly understand overall app security posture
- Filter and search through hundreds of findings
- Identify the most critical security issues
- Export filtered data for reporting

## Solution Approach
A React-based dashboard that transforms raw vulnerability analysis JSON into an interactive, visual interface with:
- High-level security metrics and scoring
- Interactive charts showing finding distribution
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Detailed finding exploration
- Export functionality

## User Experience Goals
1. **Quick Assessment**: Users should immediately see security score and key metrics
2. **Easy Navigation**: Intuitive filtering and search to find specific issues
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Click-through to detailed finding information
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Support for multiple apps and bulk operations
5. **Export Capability**: Generate reports from filtered data

## Key Features
- **Security Score Gauge**: Visual representation of overall app security
- **Interactive Charts**: Pie charts for severity and section distribution
- **Advanced Filters**: By severity, section, labels, search terms, file paths
- **Findings Table**: Virtualized table for large datasets
- **Detail Drawer**: Side panel with comprehensive finding information
- **File Upload**: Drag-drop interface for JSON files
- **Multi-app Support**: Switch between different analysis files

## Data Flow
1. User uploads JSON file → Parser normalizes data → Store in Context
2. Overview page displays summary metrics and charts
3. Findings page shows filterable table of all findings
4. User clicks finding → Detail drawer opens with full information
5. Filters update → Table re-renders with filtered results
6. User can export filtered data in various formats

## Success Metrics
- Time to understand app security posture < 30 seconds
- Ability to filter and find specific findings quickly
- Support for files with 200k+ lines without performance issues
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
